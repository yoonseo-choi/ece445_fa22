Had a meeting with the team to brainstorm about what part to use for lateral movement feedback.
2 part options we came up with:
- servo motors (we haven't figured out how we will modulate motors)
- magnetic friction brakes (haven't found a part that would fit fot our design)

Did some research on the parts I've mentioned and found a few different products

Our team decided on using servo motors for lateral movement feedback after more research and having some talk with TA.

We ordered STM32 MCU

We finalized our parts list and started ordering them.

Yoonseo and I started working on the schematics.
