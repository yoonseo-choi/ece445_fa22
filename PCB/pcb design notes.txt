will use a via to connect all components need connection with
usb-u (U1_pin4). we can use the back side of the board

J15_tim2_ch2 needs to be connected to U1_pin55 through a via
or just a longer route

stm32 pin layout: (1~16), (17~32), (33~48), (49~64)
	should we split J5, J6, and J7 into more headers?
	this would clean up the pcb layout much better
