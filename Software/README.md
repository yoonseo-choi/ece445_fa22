Only uploaded the project content since the entire unreal engine project was too large. If you want to run this you need unreal engine 5.0.3 and you'll need this plugin: https://github.com/videofeedback/Unreal_Engine_SerialCOM_Plugin/. You'll have to create a project, import all the content and insert it into the scene. The colision option may reset so you may need to set the colision option for the fingers to BlockAllDynamic.
